# Publications

There are a few types of publications that are uploaded on a regular basis:

* Weekly Bulletin (public)
* Church Family (private)
* Newsletter (private)
* Neighbourhood List's (private)

These are uploaded on a weekly basis by the Office Administrator.  The Office Admin then triggers a notification
that goes out to all those who are subscribed that simply tells them to check the website for the new publications.

Each class of publication is listed out on the website in a giant list.  On the public side, this only
includes one list for the Weekly Bullitin.  On the private side, once you login, there is one list for each publication
 type.

 Some improvements could make:

 * Single page where everyone looks at all document classes.
 * Anonymous / authenticated and then specific role would determine what documents someone sees.
 * Date popup selector to go back to a specific date and bring up all allowed publications from that date.
 * At the least select's need to go - inaccessible.
